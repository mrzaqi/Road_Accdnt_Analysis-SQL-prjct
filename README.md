🚦 Road Accidents Analysis Project 🚦

I am excited to share my latest data analysis project where I leveraged a comprehensive dataset to uncover critical insights into road accidents.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Urban vs. Rural Accidents: Found higher accident rates in urban areas.
Day of the Week: Weekends, particularly Saturdays, show the highest number of accidents.
Vehicle Age: Older vehicles tend to be involved in more severe accidents.
Weather Conditions: Adverse weather significantly increases accident severity.
Impact Side: Left-hand side impacts are the most common.
Journey Purpose: Leisure journeys are often linked to more severe accidents.
This analysis aims to enhance road safety by identifying high-risk factors and patterns. The insights can help inform policy formulation, resource allocation, and public awareness campaigns.
