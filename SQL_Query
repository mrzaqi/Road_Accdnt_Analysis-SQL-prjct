--Question 1: How many accidents have occurred in urban areas versus rural areas?

SELECT
	[Area],
	COUNT([AccidentIndex]) AS 'Total Accident'
FROM 
	[dbo].[accident]
GROUP BY 
	[Area];




--Question 2: Which day of the week has the highest number of accidents?

SELECT 
	[Day],
	COUNT([AccidentIndex]) 'Total Accident'
FROM 
	[dbo].[accident]
GROUP BY 
	[Day]
ORDER BY 
	'Total Accident' DESC;





--Question 3: What is the average age of vehicles involved in accidents based on their type?

SELECT [VehicleType],
COUNT([AccidentIndex]) AS 'Totalaccident',
AVG([AgeVehicle]) AS'averageyear'
FROM [dbo].[vehicle]
WHERE [AgeVehicle] IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY [VehicleType]
ORDER BY 'Totalaccident' DESC





--Question 4: Can we identify any trends in accidents based on the age of vehicles involved?

SELECT 
	AgeGroup,
	COUNT([AccidentIndex]) AS 'TotalAccident',
	AVG([AgeVehicle]) AS 'Averageyear'
FROM(
	SELECT 
	[AccidentIndex],
	[AgeVehicle], 
	CASE 
		WHEN [AgeVehicle] BETWEEN 0 AND 5  THEN 'New'
		WHEN [AgeVehicle] BETWEEN 6 AND 10  THEN 'New'
		ELSE 'old'
		END AS 'AgeGroup'
	FROM [dbo].[vehicle]
)AS Subquery
GROUP BY AgeGroup






--Question 5: Are there any specific weather conditions that contribute to severe accidents?

SELECT 
	[WeatherConditions],
	[Severity] AS 'Condition',
	COUNT([Severity])AS 'TotalAccident'
	
FROM	
	[dbo].[accident]
GROUP BY 
	[WeatherConditions],
	[Severity]
ORDER BY TotalAccident DESC 





--Question 6: Do accidents often involve impacts on the left-hand side of vehicles?

SELECT [LeftHand],
	COUNT([AccidentIndex])AS 'TotalAccident'
FROM [dbo].[vehicle]
group by [LeftHand]
HAVING [LeftHand] IS NOT NULL;

--- 0 IS RIGHT HAND AND 1 IS LEFT HAND






--Question 7: Are there any relationships between journey purposes and the severity of accidents?

SELECT 
	V.[JourneyPurpose],
	COUNT(A.[Severity])AS 'TotalAccident',
	CASE 
		WHEN COUNT(A.[Severity])BETWEEN 0 AND 1000 THEN 'Low' 
		WHEN COUNT(A.[Severity])BETWEEN 1001 AND 100 THEN 'Moderate'
		ELSE'High'
		END AS 'LEVEL'
FROM
	[dbo].[accident]A
JOIN
	[dbo].[vehicle]V ON V.[AccidentIndex] = A.[AccidentIndex]
GROUP BY 
	V.[JourneyPurpose]
ORDER BY 'TotalAccident' DESC






-- Question 8: Calculate the average age of vehicles involved in accidents,
-- considering Day light and point of impact:



DECLARE @Impact varchar(100)
DECLARE @Light varchar(100) 
SET @Impact = 'offside'
SET @Light = 'Darkness'

SELECT A.[LightConditions],
V.[PointImpact], 
AVG(V.[AgeVehicle]) AS 'Average Year'
FROM [dbo].[accident] A
JOIN [dbo].[vehicle] V ON V.[AccidentIndex] = A.[AccidentIndex]
GROUP BY A.[LightConditions], V.[PointImpact]
HAVING [PointImpact]= @Impact AND [LightConditions] = @Light
